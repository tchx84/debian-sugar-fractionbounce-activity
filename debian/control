Description: Sugar Learning Platform - FractionBounce activity
 Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
 Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
 education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
 offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.
 .
 Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software
 packages that automatically save your work - producing specific
 instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many
 Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may
 be invited to join a collective Activity session.
 .
 This package contains the FractionBounce activity. FractionBounce is a game
 that prompts the player to nudge a bouncing ball to land at a point on the
 bottom of the screen that is an estimate of a given fraction. if 2/3
 is displayed on the ball, then the ball must land 2/3 the distance along
 the bottom.
